        <p class="speech">Now they are downstairs, sitting under the stairs. I said to
            them, "Won't you come up," I said, "You can't go on like this," and they
            simply cried, "We don't know where father is." They said, "He may be
            burnt up by now." What an idea! And in the yard there are some people...
            also undressed.

            <p class="direction">[Takes a dress out of the cupboard] </p>
            <p class="speech">Take this grey dress.... And
            this... and the blouse as well.... Take the skirt, too, nurse.... My
            God! How awful it is! The whole of the Kirsanovsky Road seems to have
            burned down. Take this... and this.... 
            </p>

            <p class="speech">Couldn't you call Ferapont, Olga dear. I can hardly manage....

            <p class="speech">They'll never answer.... [At the door] Come here, whoever
            there is! </p>
            <p class="direction">[Through the open door can be seen a window, red with flame:
            afire-engine is heard passing the house] </p>
            <p class="speech">How awful this is. And how I'm
            sick of it!</p>
            <p class="direction">[FERAPONT enters] </p>
            <p class="speech">Take these things down.... The Kolotilin
            girls are down below... and let them have them. This, too.
            </p>

            <h3 class="FERAPONT">FERAPONT</h3>
            <p class="speech">Yes'm. In the year twelve Moscow was burning too. Oh, my God!
            The Frenchmen were surprised.
            </p>

            <h3 class="OLGA">OLGA</h3>
            <p class="speech">Go on, go on....

            <h3 class="FERAPONT">FERAPONT</h3>
            <p class="speech">Yes'm. </p>
            <p class="direction">[Exit.]
            </p>

            <h3 class="OLGA">OLGA</h3>
            <p class="speech">Nurse, dear, let them have everything. We don't want anything.
            Give it all to them, nurse.... I'm tired, I can hardly keep on my
            legs.... The Vershinins mustn't be allowed to go home.... The girls can
            sleep in the drawing-room, and Alexander Ignateyevitch can go downstairs
            to the Baron's flat... Fedotik can go there, too, or else into our
            dining-room.... The doctor is drunk, beastly drunk, as if on purpose,
            so nobody can go to him. Vershinin's wife, too, may go into the
            drawing-room.
